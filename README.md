# Rolling-Ball

Assignment 1: 
This assignment is to implement the Bresenham’s scan-conversion algorithm for circles and some simple transformations, as well as a simple animation to grow the circles, using the OpenGL programming libraries under Visual C++.

Assignment 2:
This assignment is to implement a simple animation by rolling a sphere which is modeled by a wireframe representation, with some user-interface capabilities. You will practice transformations and viewings, as well as programming with shader-based OpenGL using vertex buffer objects.

Assignment 3:
This assignment extends Assignment 2 by adding the option of producing the shadow effect (with respect to a fixed light source) while rolling a sphere, as well as the options of shading and lighting. You will practice implementing three main techniques: (1) producing a shadow, (2) drawing a decal on top of an object — in this case the shadow is a decal on top of the ground, and
(3) shading and lighting using programmable shaders. (Consult Lecture Notes for techniques of producing shadow and decal effects, and Lecture Notes and sample code “Handout: rotate-cubeshading.cpp” for shading and lighting.)
